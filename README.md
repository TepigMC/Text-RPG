# Text RPG
Text RPG is a text based role playing game made in Java.
It has a randomly generated world that extends infinitely.
It uses text art to display the map instead of using images.

I document all of the methods that I write (except for test cases) using javadoc comments.
In Eclipse and other IDE's, when you hover over a method with javadocs,
it will display that information in a tooltip.

I also document my progress in [commits](https://github.com/TepigMC/Text-RPG/commits/master) on GitHub to be able to safely roll back to a previous version of the code.
